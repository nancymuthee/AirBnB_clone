	Description of the project
Creating a clone of the Airbnb website in ALX from scratch. 
After 4 months, we will have a complete web application composed by:
A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data (data = objects)
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
